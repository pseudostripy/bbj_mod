# DarkSouls2BabyJumpMod
## Description
When Dark Souls II is first opened, this dll is automatically loaded. As long as the Dinput8.dll is in
your game folder when you start the game, the "No Baby Jump variant 1 (full)" inject is automatically enabled 
and remains active until the game closes. CE inject active at all times. 
This has been written to make it simpler for newer speedrunners to use, and to save the hassle 
of opening and enabling CE each time you open the game.

## Install
Copy the Dinput8.dll into the Dark Souls II game folder (often found at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dark Souls II\Game).
If a Dinput8.dll file already exists in the game folder, either rename that file to something else, or overwrite it.

## Uninstall
Rename or delete Dinput8.dll from the Dark Souls II game folder.
